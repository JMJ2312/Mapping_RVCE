# Mapping RVCE!

This project aims to map the different locations across my college -RVCE.
The code for this project is written in python by making use of the folium library to generate the map.
Data is taken from a csv file which contains information related to a particular location's name, type, latitude, longtitude and status.
Different coloured markers are generated depending on the type of building or area.
All areas under construction are marked with a red marker.
