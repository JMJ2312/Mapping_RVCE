# Mapping With Python!

This repo contains my experiments with folium. The code for this project is written in python by making use of the folium library to generate the map. 

I used markers in the map by marking different locations across my college -RVCE.
Data is taken from a csv file which contains information related to a particular location's name, type, latitude, longtitude and status.
Different coloured markers are generated depending on the type of building or area.
All areas under construction are marked with a red marker. The other part was adding a map layer that showed the population of each country by setting limits. Darker the colour- more the population of the country.
A layer control panel enables the toggling between the different layers of the map
