# Mapping With Python!

This repo contains my experiments with folium. The code for this project is written in python by making use of the folium library to generate an HTML map. 

I used markers in the map by marking different locations across my college -RVCE.
Data is obtained from a csv file which contains information related to a particular location's name, type, latitude, longtitude and status.
Different coloured markers are generated depending on the type of building or area
All areas under construction are marked with a red marker. 
The other part was adding a map layer that showed the population of each country by setting predefined limits. Darker the colour- more the population of the country.
A layer control panel enables toggling between the different layers of the map
